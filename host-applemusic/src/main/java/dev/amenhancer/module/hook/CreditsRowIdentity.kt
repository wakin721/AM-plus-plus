 * Process-local semantic identity for inflated lyric writers-credits rows.

 * Credits rows are direct RecyclerView items that the generic lyrics-line heuristic rejects
 * (dynamic roots contain an ImageView; static roots are a custom TextView), so the blur runtime
 * classifies them through this identity instead. Deliberately independent from
 * [InstrumentalRowIdentity]: credits are never three-dot anchors.
