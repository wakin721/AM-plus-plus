/**
 * Ready-late I2 re-entry ledger. When PlayerLyricsViewFragment.I2 installs a
 * valid native pointer whose custom replacement is still preparing, the I2
 * hook records the exact fragment instance and Apple Music ID here. Once the
 * background session publishes the replacement pointer and this ledger is
 * invoked, every still-live waiting entry for that ID is consumed and I2 is
 * re-entered with the ready replacement — but only while the same fragment
 * is still usable, the replacement is still ready, and the fragment still
 * reports the same Apple Music ID. The ready replacement is confirmed before
 * any identity read or rebind, so a stale fragment is never rebound for an
 * ID whose replacement is no longer ready. A fragment that still reports the
 * previous song may then be rebound to the exact published current item,
 * using the same recently-current identity guard as the I2 hook, so an
 * I2(null) entry recorded while the new song's mapping was still preparing
 * can still be applied; when the replacement is missing or any guard fails,
 * the fragment identity is left untouched and the entry is dropped with the
 * native pointer staying installed.
 *
 * The ledger is keyed by fragment identity, never equals, so a replacement
 * fragment with equal state can never be confused with the recorded one.
 * Keys hold fragments weakly and cleared entries are swept on every access,
 * so a dead fragment cannot keep an entry alive forever and the ledger can
 * never grow without limit. Every entry is consumed exactly once before
 * re-entry, so duplicate publish callbacks cannot loop. [recordMiss],
 * [dismiss] and [onReplacementPublished] are safe to call from any thread;
 * every gate and the re-entry itself fail open, leaving the native pointer
 * installed.
